# loan-prediction
In this project, we would be addressing the problem of fraud in loan application in banks. The applicant would fill in and attach some data about his financial history, current wage, social status, etc... Then, the bank decision making committee would either accept or reject his application. There are two critical issues in this process, one of them is time, it takes from one month to three, here in Egypt, for the smallest loan amounts. The second issue, which is the censorious obstacle there, is that the committee might be biased to many attributes of the applicant, such as ethnic group, religion, job history, etc.
